## Why I Picked Physical Therapy
My journey into physical therapy started with my mother. After she underwent several major knee surgeries, I was there for most of her appointments. 

### Key Motivations:
* **Firsthand Experience:** Watching the recovery process from surgery to mobility.
* **Restoring Agency:** Helping people regain control over their physical lives.
* **Science of Movement:** Developing a deep interest in how the body heals.

> "I want to be the catalyst for transformation in others’ lives, just as I saw my mother do."
