In our daily lives, we like to think we have total **agency** over what we buy. But as I explored in my recent analysis of CeraVe’s “Clear Acne and Prevent New Breakouts” advertisement, our choices are often carefully guided by three powerful rhetorical tools: **Pathos, Ethos, and Logos.**

### The Emotional Hook (Pathos)
Acne isn't just a skin condition; it’s an emotional burden that affects self-esteem. CeraVe uses **pathos** by showing us images of "emotional liberation"—models who transition from troubled skin to radiant, smiling faces. They aren't just selling a cleanser; they are selling the *feeling* of being confident again.

### The Expert Voice (Ethos)
CeraVe relies heavily on **ethos** by framing their products as "developed with dermatologists." By using a clinical, minimalist aesthetic, they position themselves as a scientific authority. We feel "safe" choosing them because an expert has signed off on it.

### The Logical Foundation (Logos)
Finally, they appeal to our **logos**, or logic. While the ad is short, it implies a research-based foundation. It makes the purchase feel like a rational decision rather than an impulsive one.

### The Paradox of Choice
This is where the **Agency Paradox** comes back in. We feel empowered when we buy a product that promises to "clear" our skin, but that choice was built on a layered message designed to connect with our hearts and minds.
