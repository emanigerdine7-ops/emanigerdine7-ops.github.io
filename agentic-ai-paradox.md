            <h2>The Agency Paradox: When AI Starts Acting for Itself</h2>
            <p><em>January 23, 2026</em></p>
            <hr>
            
            <p>In my exploration of "The Agency Paradox," I’ve been thinking about the line between tools we control and tools that act on their own. A recent article from <a href="https://www.teksystems.com/en/insights/version-next-now/2025/agentic-ai">TEKsystems</a> perfectly captures this tension as we move into the era of <strong>Agentic AI.</strong></p>

            <p>The paradox is simple: As we give AI more "agency" to solve our problems, we actually have to become more vigilant in how we monitor it.</p>

            <h3>From Assistance to Autonomy</h3>
            <p>We are moving away from tools that just answer questions toward "doers" that can interpret context and execute workflows. These agents can collaborate with each other to solve complex problems, potentially automating up to 70% of office tasks in the next decade.</p>

            <h3>The Supervision Gap</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest points in the article is that Agentic AI is not "set-it-and-forget-it." Because these tools can interact with databases and move data, the risk of error is higher. This is the heart of my blog's theme: to gain the freedom of automation, we must invest more in oversight.</p>

            <p><strong>What do you think? Are we ready for AI that takes the next step for us?</strong></p>

Beyond the Chatbot: Why Agentic AI is the Real Bridge to the Future
We’ve all spent the last year getting used to "Chatbot AI." You type a prompt, it gives you an answer, and you decide what to do next. But a recent deep dive from TEKsystems suggests we are already standing on the edge of the next great shift: Agentic AI.

If generative AI was the "thinker," Agentic AI is the "doer."

TEKsystems’ latest insight, "Version Next, Now," highlights a crucial evolution: we are moving away from tools that just provide information toward autonomous agents that can interpret context, make decisions, and execute multi-step workflows.

Here are three key takeaways from their perspective, and what they mean for the future of work.

1. From Assistance to Autonomy

The article makes a powerful distinction: Agentic AI doesn’t just sit in a window waiting for a prompt. It operates via an "orchestration layer," allowing multiple specialized agents to collaborate.

Think about the difference between an AI that writes an email for you (Generative) and an AI that notices a supply chain delay, identifies three alternative vendors, negotiates a trial price based on your historical data, and presents you with the final contract for signature (Agentic). TEKsystems notes that these agents could automate up to 70% of office tasks in the next decade. That isn't just a productivity boost; it’s a fundamental restructuring of how we spend our time.

2. The "Set-it-and-Forget-it" Trap

One of the most grounded pieces of advice in the article comes from Nader Mherabi of NYU Langone Health. He warns that Agentic AI is not a "set-it-and-forget-it" application.

As AI gains more agency, the stakes for Governance and Security skyrocket. If an agent has the power to interact with your APIs and move data between systems, a "hallucination" isn't just a wrong word in a paragraph—it’s a broken business process. The TEKsystems report rightly emphasizes that "scaffolding the decision space"—creating clear boundaries and human-in-the-loop checkpoints—is the only way to scale this technology safely.

3. Solving the Mid-Level Talent Gap

I found the case study on Aireon (the satellite network operator) particularly fascinating. They are using Agentic AI to bridge a massive skills gap in cybersecurity.

Instead of waiting years to train a mid-level threat analyst to hunt through 150 million log events, they deployed agents that can remediate vulnerabilities in hours. This is the "Change Agent" in action: AI isn't replacing the human; it’s giving a small team of five people the defensive capabilities of a team of fifty.

The Bottom Line

The TEKsystems article serves as a wake-up call for leaders who think they’ve already "solved" their AI strategy. If your strategy is only focused on Large Language Models (LLMs) and chatbots, you’re missing the engine that will actually drive the next decade of business modernization.

The goal isn't just to have an AI that can talk to us. The goal is to have an AI that can work with us—and for us.

## Reclaiming Power Through Movement

When people think of Physical Therapy, they usually think of ice packs, resistance bands, and a bit of "good pain." But after watching my mom navigate her knee surgeries, I realized PT is actually a masterclass in **human agency**.

In my ENGL 170 class, we talk a lot about the **"Agency Paradox"**—the idea of having power over our choices while being shaped by forces outside our control. There is no better place to see this in action than a rehabilitation clinic.

### The Paradox of Healing
When you’re injured, your body feels like it’s betrayed you. You’ve lost the *agency* to do simple things, like walk up a flight of stairs or carry groceries. You are limited by biology and the strict "system" of recovery. 

However, the "paradox" is that to regain that power, you have to submit to a process. You have to trust a therapist and follow a rigid protocol to eventually win back your independence. 

### Connecting the Sciences
My current coursework highlights this paradox every day:
* **Kinesiology & Biomechanics:** We study the "mechanical" limits of the body. Even if your mind *wants* to jump, your bones and tendons have their own rules. Agency is restricted by physics.
* **Statistics:** In PT, we look at "probability of recovery." Statistics tell us what is likely to happen (the external force), but the patient’s individual effort (their agency) is the variable that can change the outcome.

### Why I’m Choosing This Path
Seeing my mom show up to every appointment taught me that agency isn't just about doing whatever you want; it’s about the **will to work through limitations**. 

I want to be a Physical Therapist because I want to be the person who helps others reclaim their agency. I want to help people transition from:
* *"I can't move my leg."*
* To *"I am moving my leg."*
* To *"I am choosing where I walk today."*

Physical therapy is more than just fixing bones and muscles; it’s about restoring the power of the individual. As I continue building this blog, I’m realizing that my career goals and my classwork are much more connected than I originally thought.
