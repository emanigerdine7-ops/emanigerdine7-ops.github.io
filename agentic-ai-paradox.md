            <h2>The Agency Paradox: When AI Starts Acting for Itself</h2>
            <p><em>January 23, 2026</em></p>
            <hr>
            
            <p>In my exploration of "The Agency Paradox," I’ve been thinking about the line between tools we control and tools that act on their own. A recent article from <a href="https://www.teksystems.com/en/insights/version-next-now/2025/agentic-ai">TEKsystems</a> perfectly captures this tension as we move into the era of <strong>Agentic AI.</strong></p>

            <p>The paradox is simple: As we give AI more "agency" to solve our problems, we actually have to become more vigilant in how we monitor it.</p>

            <h3>From Assistance to Autonomy</h3>
            <p>We are moving away from tools that just answer questions toward "doers" that can interpret context and execute workflows. These agents can collaborate with each other to solve complex problems, potentially automating up to 70% of office tasks in the next decade.</p>

            <h3>The Supervision Gap</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest points in the article is that Agentic AI is not "set-it-and-forget-it." Because these tools can interact with databases and move data, the risk of error is higher. This is the heart of my blog's theme: to gain the freedom of automation, we must invest more in oversight.</p>

            <p><strong>What do you think? Are we ready for AI that takes the next step for us?</strong></p>

Beyond the Chatbot: Why Agentic AI is the Real Bridge to the Future
We’ve all spent the last year getting used to "Chatbot AI." You type a prompt, it gives you an answer, and you decide what to do next. But a recent deep dive from TEKsystems suggests we are already standing on the edge of the next great shift: Agentic AI.

If generative AI was the "thinker," Agentic AI is the "doer."

TEKsystems’ latest insight, "Version Next, Now," highlights a crucial evolution: we are moving away from tools that just provide information toward autonomous agents that can interpret context, make decisions, and execute multi-step workflows.

Here are three key takeaways from their perspective, and what they mean for the future of work.

1. From Assistance to Autonomy

The article makes a powerful distinction: Agentic AI doesn’t just sit in a window waiting for a prompt. It operates via an "orchestration layer," allowing multiple specialized agents to collaborate.

Think about the difference between an AI that writes an email for you (Generative) and an AI that notices a supply chain delay, identifies three alternative vendors, negotiates a trial price based on your historical data, and presents you with the final contract for signature (Agentic). TEKsystems notes that these agents could automate up to 70% of office tasks in the next decade. That isn't just a productivity boost; it’s a fundamental restructuring of how we spend our time.

2. The "Set-it-and-Forget-it" Trap

One of the most grounded pieces of advice in the article comes from Nader Mherabi of NYU Langone Health. He warns that Agentic AI is not a "set-it-and-forget-it" application.

As AI gains more agency, the stakes for Governance and Security skyrocket. If an agent has the power to interact with your APIs and move data between systems, a "hallucination" isn't just a wrong word in a paragraph—it’s a broken business process. The TEKsystems report rightly emphasizes that "scaffolding the decision space"—creating clear boundaries and human-in-the-loop checkpoints—is the only way to scale this technology safely.

3. Solving the Mid-Level Talent Gap

I found the case study on Aireon (the satellite network operator) particularly fascinating. They are using Agentic AI to bridge a massive skills gap in cybersecurity.

Instead of waiting years to train a mid-level threat analyst to hunt through 150 million log events, they deployed agents that can remediate vulnerabilities in hours. This is the "Change Agent" in action: AI isn't replacing the human; it’s giving a small team of five people the defensive capabilities of a team of fifty.

The Bottom Line

The TEKsystems article serves as a wake-up call for leaders who think they’ve already "solved" their AI strategy. If your strategy is only focused on Large Language Models (LLMs) and chatbots, you’re missing the engine that will actually drive the next decade of business modernization.

## What is the Agency Paradox?

In my ENGL 170 class, we are exploring the **Agency Paradox**. At its simplest, agency is our ability to act and make choices. The "paradox" is that while we think we are in total control, our choices are often shaped by our environment, our families, and even our biology.

### My Personal Connection
When I first heard this term, I immediately thought of my journey toward becoming a **Physical Therapist**. 

I didn't just wake up one day and decide on this career out of nowhere. My agency was shaped by a major life event: my mother's knee surgeries. Being there for her appointments and watching her work to regain her mobility was the "external force" that guided my "internal choice."



### The Paradox in the Clinic
In Physical Therapy, the paradox is everywhere:
1. **The Body's Limits:** A patient has the *will* to walk (agency), but their injured anatomy is an "external" constraint they cannot simply ignore.
2. **The Role of the Guide:** As a future PT, I will be an external force in my patients' lives. My job is to give them the tools to regain their own agency.

### Why This Matters for My Blog
This page, which I've titled **"The Agency Paradox,"** is where I will document my growth as a student and a future professional. Whether I'm studying **Kinesiology**, tackling **Statistics** homework, or learning about **Nutrition**, I am constantly looking at how we can overcome the things that limit us.

Through this blog, I want to show that even when we are facing a "paradox"—where we feel stuck or limited—we still have the power to move forward.
