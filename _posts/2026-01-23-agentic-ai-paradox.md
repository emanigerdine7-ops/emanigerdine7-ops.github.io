title: "The Agency Paradox: When AI Starts Acting for Itself"

In my exploration of "The Agency Paradox," I’ve been thinking about the line between tools we control and tools that act on their own. A recent article from [TEKsystems](https://www.teksystems.com/en/insights/version-next-now/2025/agentic-ai) perfectly captures this tension as we move into the era of **Agentic AI.**

The paradox is simple but profound: As we give AI more "agency" to solve our problems autonomously, we actually have to become more vigilant in how we govern and monitor it. 

### From Chatting to Doing
Most of us are used to AI that answers questions. But TEKsystems highlights that we are moving toward an orchestration of specialized agents. These aren't just chatbots; they are "doers" that can interpret context and execute workflows. 

### The Security & Supervision Gap
One of the most striking points in the article is that Agentic AI is not "set-it-and-forget-it." As these tools gain the ability to interact with databases and move data, the risk of a "hallucination" becomes a real-world business error. This is the heart of the paradox: to gain the freedom of automation, we must invest more in oversight.

### Bridging the Talent Gap
The article features a case study on Aireon, a satellite operator using Agentic AI to hunt for cyber threats. By using these agents, a small team of five can do the work of a much larger department. It shows that AI agency doesn't have to replace humans—it can amplify our ability to handle massive amounts of data.

### Final Thoughts
As I continue to track the "Agency Paradox" for ENGL 170, it's clear that the future of AI isn't just about better conversations—it's about how much authority we are willing to delegate to the machines.

**What do you think? Are we ready for AI that doesn't just suggest the next word, but takes the next step?**
