### The Spark
Most people choose a career based on a salary or a title, but my interest in Physical Therapy started in a waiting room. Watching my mother go through multiple knee surgeries was a turning point for me. Being there for her appointments, I didn't just see exercises; I saw the moment someone regains their independence. 

That experience turned a curiosity into a calling. I realized I didn't just want to understand how the body moves—I wanted to be the person helping others move again.

### The Science Behind the Movement
As I work through my current courses, the pieces of the puzzle are coming together:
* **Kinesiology:** Understanding the mechanics of joint movement and muscle activation.
* **Nutrition:** Learning how the body fuels the repair of tissues after surgery.
* **Statistics:** Analyzing patient outcomes to provide the best evidence-based care.



### My Mission
I want to be a Physical Therapist who makes the hard work of recovery interactive and engaging. I believe that when a patient understands the *why* behind an exercise, they gain the agency to heal faster.
