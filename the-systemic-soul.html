    [cite_start]<h1>The Systemic Soul: A Response to "Testing Moral Agency" [cite: 1]</h1>
    
    [cite_start]<p>This analysis provides a necessary "cold shower" for the debate over AI and professional judgment[cite: 2]. [cite_start]By reframing moral agency as the willingness to be judged by the system for your deviation, it replaces the "ghost in the machine" with tangible accountability[cite: 3].</p>

    <div class="section-title">1. [cite_start]The Paradox of the "Authorized Deviation" [cite: 4]</div>
    [cite_start]<p>A profound irony exists: we celebrate "heroic" individuals who break rules for the greater good, yet in professional contexts, we only call that act "right" if it maps back to a higher-order rule[cite: 5]. [cite_start]Moral agency is about having a mastery of the script’s spirit to know when its letter is failing[cite: 8].</p>

    <div class="section-title">2. [cite_start]The Three Dimensions of Judgment [cite: 9]</div>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Perceptual:</strong> Determining if a ball is in the zone (High automation potential)[cite: 11].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Interpretive:</strong> Deciding if silence indicates grief or ideation (Low automation potential)[cite: 12].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Procedural:</strong> Determining which framework applies[cite: 13].</li>
    </ul>
    [cite_start]<p>AI lacks "standing" because it cannot be held to account by a licensing board or court in a way that carries personal or professional cost[cite: 14, 15]. [cite_start]It cannot "accept the risk" of being wrong[cite: 16].</p>

    <div class="section-title">3. [cite_start]Reversibility and "Skin in the Game" [cite: 17]</div>
    [cite_start]<p>We grant humans agency in high-stakes, irreversible scenarios like therapy because we demand a decision-maker with "skin in the game"[cite: 19]. [cite_start]A therapist deviates and risks their license (a sacrifice play), whereas an AI can only be recalibrated or deleted[cite: 20, 21].</p>

    [cite_start]<div class="section-title">The Synthesis [cite: 23]</div>
    [cite_start]<p>Perhaps moral agency is the tether between the relational space (care as motivation) and the structural space (systemic accountability as justification)[cite: 25, 26, 27, 28].</p>
