            <h2>The Choice Signal: Who Really Sets the Price?</h2>
            <p><em>January 23, 2026</em></p>
            <hr>
            
            <p>In my latest exploration of "The Agency Paradox," I came across an entry on the <em>Plate Composition</em> blog titled <a href="https://buildlittleworlds.github.io/plate-composition-blog/the-price-signal.html">“The Price Signal,”</a> and it got me thinking about the central theme of this blog: <strong>Agency.</strong></p>

            <p>When we see a Taylor Swift ticket listed for $800, our immediate reaction is a sense of powerlessness. We feel like the system has taken away our agency to enjoy art at a fair price. But "The Price Signal" suggests something different: that the price isn't a villain—it's a messenger.</p>

            <h3>The Agency of the Crowd</h3>
            <p>The article points out that high prices exist because millions of people <em>want</em> those seats. In a way, the price is the ultimate expression of collective agency. It’s the sum total of thousands of individual choices. If we capped the price, we wouldn't be fixing the value; we would just be changing who loses their agency to get a seat.</p>

            <h3>The Paradox of Value</h3>
            <p>The paradox here is that while we want the freedom to buy what we love at a "fair" price, that very freedom is what drives prices up when everyone else wants the same thing. As I track the "Agency Paradox" for ENGL 170, it becomes clear that we can't ignore the market's role as a reflection of us.</p>

            <p><strong>What do you think? Is the price a signal of our collective freedom, or a barrier to it?</strong></p>
