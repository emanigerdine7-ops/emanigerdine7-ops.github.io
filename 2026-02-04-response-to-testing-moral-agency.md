### The Paradox of the "Authorized Deviation"
[cite_start]Your analysis provides a necessary "cold shower" for the debate over AI and professional judgment[cite: 2]. [cite_start]By reframing moral agency as the willingness to be judged by the system for your deviation, we replace the mystical "ghost in the machine" with tangible accountability[cite: 3].

[cite_start]It suggests that moral agency isn’t about being "free" from the script; it’s about having a deep enough mastery of the script’s **spirit** to know when its **letter** is failing[cite: 7, 8].

### The Three Dimensions of Judgment
We can categorize the types of judgment vital for AI discourse as:
* **Perceptual (Umpire):** Is the ball in the zone? (High potential for automation) [cite_start][cite: 11].
* **Interpretive (Therapist):** Is this silence grief or ideation? (Low potential for current automation due to context-switching) [cite_start][cite: 12].
* [cite_start]**Procedural (Both):** Which framework applies here?[cite: 13].

[cite_start]If moral agency is "distributed across a system," AI lacks agency because it lacks **standing**[cite: 14]. [cite_start]An AI cannot be held to account by a licensing board in a way that carries personal or professional cost; it cannot "accept the risk" of being wrong[cite: 15, 16].

### Reversibility and "Skin in the Game"
[cite_start]Humans are granted agency in high-stakes, irreversible scenarios like therapy because we demand a decision-maker who has "skin in the game"[cite: 19]. [cite_start]When a therapist deviates from protocol to save a life, they risk their license—a "sacrifice play" that an AI, which can only be recalibrated or deleted, cannot make[cite: 20, 21].

### The Synthesis
[cite_start]This suggests a tether between two views[cite: 27]:
* [cite_start]**Relational Space:** The "care" and "I-Thou" connection that facilitates healing[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**Structural Space:** The "I-System" connection that ensures safety and standards[cite: 26].

[cite_start]In this model, "care" is the **motivation** to deviate from the script, but "systemic accountability" is the **justification** for doing so[cite: 28].
