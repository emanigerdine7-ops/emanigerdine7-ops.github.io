    <h1>The Systemic Soul: A Response to "Testing Moral Agency"</h1>
    <p class="date">February 4, 2026</p>

    <section>
        <h3>The Paradox of the "Authorized Deviation"</h3>
        <p>This analysis provides a necessary "cold shower" for the debate over AI and professional judgment. By reframing moral agency as <strong>the willingness to be judged by the system for your deviation</strong>, we replace the mystical "ghost in the machine" with something more tangible: accountability.</p>
        <p>It suggests that moral agency isn't about being free from the script; it’s about having a deep enough mastery of the script’s spirit to know when its letter is failing.</p>

        <h3>The Three Dimensions of Judgment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Perceptual (Umpire):</strong> Is the ball in the zone? (High potential for automation).</li>
            <li><strong>Interpretive (Therapist):</strong> Is this silence grief or ideation? (Low potential for current automation due to context-switching).</li>
            <li><strong>Procedural (Both):</strong> Which framework applies here?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If moral agency is distributed across a system, then AI’s lack of agency isn’t just a lack of "feeling"—it’s a lack of standing. An AI cannot be held to account by a licensing board or a court of law in a way that carries personal or professional cost. It cannot "accept the risk" of being wrong.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>Reversibility and "Skin in the Game"</h3>
        <p>The point about reversibility is a strong contribution to the Agency Paradox. We grant humans agency in high-stakes, irreversible scenarios (like therapy) precisely because the "cost" of a mistake is so high that we demand a decision-maker who has "skin in the game."</p>
        <p>When a therapist deviates from protocol to save a life, they risk their license. They are making a sacrifice play. An AI can be "recalibrated" or "deleted," but it cannot sacrifice anything.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>The Synthesis</h3>
        <p>Perhaps moral agency is the tether between two spaces: the <strong>relational space</strong> (the care and connection that facilitates healing) and the <strong>structural space</strong> (the professional system that ensures standards).</p>
        <p>In this view, "care" is the motivation to deviate from the script, but "systemic accountability" is the justification for doing so.</p>
